# GAN-Monet-Art

We recognize the works of artists through their unique style, such as color choices or brush strokes. The artists like Claude Monet can now be imitated with algorithms thanks to generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this project, we will bring that Monet style to photos or recreate the style of monet!

We decided to use [Mon√®t dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/data) on Kaggle. We will try out more style like Van Gogh, Cezanne or someone else if we have more time (For these part, the paintings of these artists could be found at The [CycleGAN Datasets](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN). and also could be downloaded at [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/)

## The Challenge
we have 300 Monet style image and 7028 photos in our dataset and they are all in 256x256 format. We may need to extract the style patten from Monet image and convert the style onto the photo we have.
